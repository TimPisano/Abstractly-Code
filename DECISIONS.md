# Implementation Decisions

## Backend Structure (2026-08-12)

Built Python backend for lease PDF extraction with the following design choices:

### Architecture
- **Modular design**: Separated PDF extraction (`pdf_extractor.py`) from field extraction (`field_extractor.py`) for better maintainability
- **API layer**: Flask API (`api.py`) handles HTTP concerns separately from business logic
- **Reason**: This separation makes it easier to swap out components (e.g., add ML-based extraction later) without touching API code

### PDF Text Extraction Strategy
- **Primary method**: PyPDF2 for digital PDFs (fast, no external dependencies)
- **Fallback**: OCR using pytesseract + pdf2image when text extraction yields < 100 chars
- **Reason**: Most modern leases are digital PDFs, so PyPDF2 handles 90% of cases efficiently. OCR is slower but handles scanned documents when needed

### Field Extraction Approach
- **Method**: Regex patterns with keyword matching
- **Not using**: Machine learning or NLP models
- **Reason**:
  - Simpler to debug and maintain for a solo learning project
  - Sufficient for standardized lease formats
  - Can add ML layer later if needed without changing API contract
  - Lower deployment complexity (no model files to manage)

### JSON Response Format
Each field returns:
```json
{
  "value": "extracted value or null",
  "source": {
    "page": page_number,
    "quote": "context snippet"
  } or null
}
```
- **Reason**: Source information helps users verify extractions and debug issues. Null values are explicit about what wasn't found.

### File Organization
- `backend/app/`: Core application modules
- `backend/tests/`: Test utilities and sample data
- **Reason**: Standard Python project layout, familiar to most developers

### Dependencies
- Flask + flask-cors: Lightweight web framework
- PyPDF2: Pure Python PDF reader
- pdf2image + pytesseract: OCR fallback
- reportlab: Test PDF generation
- **Reason**: Minimal dependencies, all well-maintained libraries

### Testing Approach
- Created sample PDF generator to ensure reproducible tests
- Included validation script that checks extraction against known values
- **Reason**: Real lease PDFs contain sensitive data; generated test data is safer to commit

### Pre-existing Files
Found `app/extract.py` and `app/main.py` already in the codebase. These appear to be an earlier implementation attempt. Left them in place but built a new, more complete system with better separation of concerns.

### Future Improvements (not implemented)
- Machine learning models for more flexible extraction
- Support for more date formats
- Additional fields (property address, landlord, etc.)
- Confidence scores
- Batch processing
